<h2>New Page</h2>
It's very easy to create a new page with GarudaID.

You can use all components that are shown in the live preview. Note, all content should be placed in .content-wrapper to fit the page correctly.

If you will use component that needs some JS codes which are included in component demo page at the end of the HTML body tag, you can just include the same JS file. If you will use component that needs an extra plugin to work, you have to include files of this plugins as they are included in the preview page.
